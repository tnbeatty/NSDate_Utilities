NSDate Utilities Category

Overview

I don't work with Cocoa's NSDate class enough to know it well, but I run into it on almost every project. Manipulating dates with NSCalendar and working with date components can be annoying. Instead of re-typing my NSDate related code all of the time, I figured it would be cool to make a category to help me out.

I'll try to update this as frequently as possible.

Suggestions? (nate.beatty@gmail.com)
